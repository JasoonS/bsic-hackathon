# MANA

This is initial work in a prototype for the MANA financial system.

This is a standard truffle project. (so the usual commands apply.)

### Attach to remix:
Run: (and `chmod +x remix-connect.sh` first if not executably yet.)

```./remix-connect.sh```

My plan is to modularise the repo into 3 main compontents.
A contracts module.
A Admin-UI module.
A User-app module.

Where the contracts module will be a submodule of both the Admin-ui and the User-app.
